# Requirements for Full Hardware Demo (FL + Hardware)
# This includes dependencies for both federated learning and hardware control
# 
# The hardware demo runs federated learning with physical hardware, so it needs:
# 1. ML/FL frameworks (torch, numpy) - REQUIRED for FL client
# 2. Hardware libraries - REQUIRED on Raspberry Pi, optional elsewhere (mock mode)

# Core ML and FL frameworks (REQUIRED - used by hardware_fl_client.py)
torch>=1.12.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Hardware libraries (REQUIRED on Raspberry Pi, optional on other systems)
# For hardware-only installation (just the controller), use: requirements-hardware.txt
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0
adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306>=2.12.0
Pillow>=9.0.0
adafruit-blinka>=8.0.0

# Note: 
# - torch and numpy are REQUIRED for the full hardware demo (FL functionality)
# - Hardware libraries are REQUIRED on Raspberry Pi, but the code will work 
#   in mock mode on non-Raspberry Pi systems (hardware libraries optional)
