# Requirements for Full Hardware Demo (FL + Hardware)
# Simplified for IoT class demo - focuses on hardware flow
# 
# NOTE: This is a SIMPLIFIED version for IoT class presentation
# - No actual model training (simulated for smooth hardware flow)
# - Focus on hardware interactions (OLED, Servo, Keypad)
# - Coordinated timing for convincing demo performance

# Core dependencies (simplified - numpy only, torch removed for simplicity)
numpy>=1.21.0

# Hardware libraries (REQUIRED on Raspberry Pi, optional on other systems)
# For hardware-only installation (just the controller), use: requirements-hardware.txt
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0
adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306>=2.12.0
Pillow>=9.0.0
adafruit-blinka>=8.0.0

# Note: 
# - torch and numpy are REQUIRED for the full hardware demo (FL functionality)
# - Hardware libraries are REQUIRED on Raspberry Pi, but the code will work 
#   in mock mode on non-Raspberry Pi systems (hardware libraries optional)
