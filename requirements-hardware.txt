# Hardware Requirements for Raspberry Pi
# These are the ONLY dependencies needed for the hardware controller
# (ev_navigation_hardware.py) to work on Raspberry Pi
#
# NOTE: This is for the hardware controller ONLY (standalone testing)
# For the full hardware demo with FL, use requirements.txt (includes torch/numpy)

# GPIO control for Raspberry Pi
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0

# I2C communication (provides board and busio modules)
adafruit-blinka>=8.0.0

# OLED Display (SSD1306) driver
adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306>=2.12.0

# Image processing for OLED display
Pillow>=9.0.0

# Note: These libraries are ONLY needed on Raspberry Pi
# The hardware controller will automatically use mock mode on non-Raspberry Pi systems
# (no hardware libraries required for mock mode)
